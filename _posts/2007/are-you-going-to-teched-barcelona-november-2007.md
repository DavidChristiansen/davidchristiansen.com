<p><strong>TechEd Developers - 05-09 November 2007, Barcelona,Â Spain</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I've just put together my first draft session agenda for the developer week - and really can't wait for the week to arrive.</p>
<p>Are you going? I'd really be interested to learn what sessions you are looking forward to. Did you manage to get a hotel within 50miles booked? More to the point did you manage to not spend a fortune on your flights?</p>
