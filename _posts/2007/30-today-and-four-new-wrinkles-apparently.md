<p>Yeah another birthday this year - not that it should be a surprise, they kinda happen every year!</p> <p>The year ahead should bring a whole lot of challenges with work, life and trying to find the elusive balance between the two, but mostly the enjoyment of seeing my son (15 weeks now) continue to grow daily.</p> <p>Last night my wife took great pleasure in pointing out a number of new wrinkles on my face. I will remember to do nothing of the sort when it's her turn later this year!</p>
