<p>PWOP.Feeder is a simple consolidated RSS feed of all feeds from Podcasting company PWOP, producers of programs such as .NET Rocks! and RunAs Radio. </p> <p>As a PWOP Ambassador I host torrents of all the shows produced by PWOP, and the reason I produced PWOP.Feeder was to provide a simple single source from which to download all the audio and video files from. </p> <p>You can use PWOP.Feeder yourself by pointing your RSS reader or RSS enabled Torrent application at</p> <p><a href="http://pwopfeeder.davidchristiansen.com"><strong><font size="4"><a href="http://pwopfeeder.davidchristiansen.com">http://pwopfeeder.davidchristiansen.com</a></font></strong></a></p> <p><strong>Update:</strong></p> <p>I have now updated PWOP.Feeder to use the <img src="http://www.codeplex.com/Argotic/Project/FileDownload.aspx?DownloadId=12850"> <a title="Argotic Syndication Framework" href="http://www.codeplex.com/Argotic/" target="_blank"><strong>Argotic Syndication Framework</strong></a> which was featured in a recent <a href="http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showID=70"><strong>DNRtv show</strong></a>.</p> <p>I would be interested in hearing from anyone that uses this service.</p>
