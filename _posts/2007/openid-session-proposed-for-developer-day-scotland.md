<p>OK Ok, a bit late with the news but the excellent and very popular UK Developer community driven event <strong><font color="#0000ff">Developer! Developer! Developer!</font> </strong>is heading to Scotland on Saturday 10th May, 2008 for <a href="http://www.developerdayscotland.com/"><strong>Developer Day Scotland</strong></a>, at the Glasgow Caledonian University.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx">call for speakers</a> is open and in response I have submitted a proposal to the organisers for me to host a session on implementing OpenID into your .NET Web Applications. More over I will be demonstrating the OpenID 2.0 specifications attempts to reduce risk of phishing - something that my company <strong><a href="http://www.netidme.net/" target="_blank">NetIDme</a> </strong>have worked hard at and addressed in our <a href="http://www.netidme.com/" target="_blank">NetIDme.com product suite</a>.</p>  <p> </p>  <p><b>What:</b>    <br><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com">Developer Day Scotland</a>    <br>Developer Day Scotland is a community event, run by community for community, which is based upon the highly successful Developer!
