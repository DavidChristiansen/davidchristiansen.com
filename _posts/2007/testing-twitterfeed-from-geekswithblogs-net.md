<p>OK, no really - time for this walk with the dog - I have been syncing up the podcasts and videos I have downloaded on my new <a href="http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/yourplan/handset" target="_blank">Orange e650</a> which runs windows mobile 6 (something else thats new to me) and have been thinking that the sync has been failing - until i discovered the <strong>'update library'</strong> option in pda's Windows Media Player. I now have 200+ items in my library.</p>
