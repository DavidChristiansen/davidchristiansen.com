<p>It's fair to say that I am very into twitter. I am loving it - it came into it's own during this year's TechEd and UK community events where I and others were able to communicate easily with each other, and give on-the-fly reviews during sessions.</p>  <p>So, when I heard that <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Jeff</a> has added new options to all accounts on <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/" target="_blank">geekswithblogs.net</a> that allows you to integrate your blog and twitter accounts - I logged into my account today and activated the service. I'm glad to see Jeff and the crew continuing to work on this site - developers love new toys!</p>  <p>At the same time, I also did my usual merry dance of changing blog skins back and forth - finally resting on Greenway, this week at least.</p>
