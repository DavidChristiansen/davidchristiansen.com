<p>Exciting times are afoot. We have just released a Community Technology Preview of DotNetOpenAuth with built in support for OAuth2.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/dotnetopenauth/download?package=DotNetOpenAuth+CTP&amp;release=OAuth2" target="_blank">Download it here</a></p>  <p>Andrew posted a notice to our discussion group earlier today</p>  <blockquote>   <p>For those of you chomping at the bit to start development with DotNetOpenAuth upcoming OAuth 2.0 support, now you can. </p>    <p><a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/dotnetopenauth/download?package=DotNetOpenAuth+CTP&amp;release=OAuth2"><strong>https://www.ohloh.net/p/dotnetopenauth/download?package=DotNetOpenAuth+CTP&amp;release=OAuth2</strong></a></p> </blockquote>  <p><font style="background-color: #fcfaf0">Please do take notice of the rider that comes with this (and any) CTP;</font></p>  <blockquote>   <p>The public API has <i>not</i> been locked down, and <b><i>please assume that critical security holes exist</i>, at this early stage in development.  The OAuth 2.0 spec is still a moving target, and I have not yet audited all the code to lock it down security-wise.  This is a preview so you can begin development with the library and provide early feedback.  </b></p>    <p><b>Do not "go live" with this version!</b> </p> </blockquote>  <p>And please don't be shy with the feedback. :)</p>  <p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p>  <p>OAuth2 Specification (<a href="http://wiki.oauth.net/OAuth-2" target="_blank">http://wiki.oauth.net/OAuth-2</a>) </p>
