<p> <p><b><img style="margin: 0px" height="236" src="http://www.singletrackworld.com/mod/submit/images/2121-1.jpg" width="200" align="right"> Brochure Extract</b><br>"Welcome to the Glasgow International Bike Film Festival. This nine day festival aims to capture the essence of all aspects of cycling and how it is being expressed through the work of some of the finest directors, cinematographers and riders working in the genre today. From the thrills and spills of downhill racing in Hypnosis through the ground breaking Collective and Stripped to the jaw dropping riding in Manifesto, there is something there for everyone to enjoy. Even if you aren't a cyclist, take a look and enter a whole new world which challenges your perceptions of what cycling is today."  <p><a href="http://www.singletrackworld.com/article.php?sid=2121">http://www.singletrackworld.com/article.php?sid=2121</a>  <p>In particular, me and ma mates will be taking up the offer below !...  <blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.thecollectivefilm.com/" target="_new" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px" height="141" alt="The Collective" src="http://static.flickr.com/90/229973485_0c7dbb2997_o.jpg" width="250" align="left"></a> Tuesday 10th October<br><b>The Collective</b> and <b>Roam</b><br>Running time : Approx 85 minutes<br>Following the sell out success of Roam at the GFT in May, from Director Darcy Wittenberg comes another opportunity to see two films which have redefined the bike film genre. Gone are the low rent camera work and thrash metal soundtracks of old to be replaced with stunning cinematography, multiple camera sequences, a mood capturing soundtrack and a cohesive narrative style. Both films represent the collaborative efforts of some of the world's best mountain bike riders and are an expression of their words, ideas and most importantly, their riding. It's easy to see why these multiple award winning films have garnered both critical and commercial success and why they have set the standard for all films to follow.<br><b><a href="http://www.thecollectivefilm.com">www.thecollectivefilm.com</a></b></p></blockquote> <p><strong>I mean... watching The Collective and Roam on the big screen is an opportunity you DON'T want to miss!</strong></p> <h3><strong>Festival Programme</strong></h3> <p>Wednesday 4th October 2006<br><b>Joe Kid on a Stingray</b><br>Running time: 90 minutes.<br>Documenting the evolution of BMX from the kids in the 1970s who first modified their bikes to look like motorcycles, Joe Kid on a Stingray is the definitive account of the history of BMX. Coupling unique archive footage with interviews with the greatest riders in the history of the sport, the film charts the history and evolution of the sport from the streets of 1970s suburban neighbourhood's to today's stadium-packed televised Dirt, Street and Halfpipe insanity. The opening sequence alone will leave you slack jawed in amazement.<br><b><a href="http://www.joekidonastingray.com">www.joekidonastingray.com</a></b> <p><img height="266" alt="image" hspace="10" src="http://www.singletrackworld.com/mod/submit/images/2121-4.jpg" width="400" vspace="10" border="0"> <p>Sunday 8th October 2006 - Triple Bill Premiere Night<br><b>Stripped</b> - European Cinema Premiere<br>Running time: 40 minutes<br>The second feature from Cleancut films, Stripped combines perfect light, beautiful footage, amazing locations, professional riders, loud helicopters, dangerous cable cams, and tight editing to produce one of the most eagerly awaited mountain bike films of the year. Showcasing the talents of big name riders such as Steve Romaniuk together with a host of riders you've never heard of but soon will, Stripped is testament to the fact that a tight budget is no barrier to big screen spectacle. A must see film that more than lives up to the hype.<br><b><a href="http://www.cleancutfilms.ca">www.cleancutfilms.ca</a></b> <p><b>Evermore</b> - UK Cinema Premiere<br>Running time: 40 minutes<br>Evermore is the collaborative effort of a group of Swiss filmmakers who bring a fresh European perspective to the genre. Through bringing some of the worlds best riders to some of the most spectacular locations in Europe, Evermore seeks to challenge the dominance of the Canadian filmmakers who have made mountain bike films their own. Since announcing the project, interest has grown through the media the world over to the point that Evermore is one of the most anticipated films of the year. See it for yourself first at the GFT.<br><b><a href="http://www.evermore.ch">www.evermore.ch</a></b> <p><b>Clorophilla</b> - UK Cinema Premiere<br>Running time: 40 minutes<br>Clorophilla eschews the conventional approach of capturing pro riders on film by bringing together a group of friends who happen to be talented riders and film makers and pooling their shared talents and skills to produce a film which is at once fresh, original and innovative. While the riding is first class, it is the friendships and an appreciation of the part that mother nature has to play as backdrop to the riding that takes centre stage. Coupled with a slick soundtrack, Clorophilla is a refreshing take on the established genre. <p>Monday 9th October<br><b>Hypnosis</b><br>Running time : 105 minutes<br>Hypnosis from Director Clay Porter is a unique fly on the wall documentary which charts the 2005 downhill mountain bike season. Capturing the highs and lows of the sport, the winning, the losing, the crashes, the injuries and the ever present need to risk everything to go that little bit faster, the film travels the globe and includes footage of the World Mountain Bike Cup Final in Fort William when local heroes Steve Pete and Tracey Mosley sent the partisan crowd into a frenzy with their winning ways. This is flat out mountain bike racing at its finest. Get ready to open your senses. <p><img height="280" alt="image" hspace="10" src="http://www.singletrackworld.com/mod/submit/images/2121-3.jpg" width="400" vspace="10" border="0"> <p>Tuesday 10th October<br><b>The Collective</b> and <b>Roam</b><br>Running time : Approx 85 minutes<br>Following the sell out success of Roam at the GFT in May, from Director Darcy Wittenberg comes another opportunity to see two films which have redefined the bike film genre.

Combining telling interviews with some hair raising footage of couriers as they duck and dive through traffic to make the next all important delivery, this film is guaranteed to make you look at couriers in an entirely new light. To be shown prior to the screenings of The Collective and Roam.<br><b><a href="http://www.singletrackworld.com/article.php?sid=2116">Download a free trailer!</a></b> <p>Thursday 12th October 2006<br><b>An Evening with Ryan Leech - Special Event</b><br>Running Time: Approx 105 minutes<br>Widely regarded as the finest trials rider in the world today, the festival will conclude with a special screening of his film, Manifesto. Trials riding has always been about finesse, control and precision. What Ryan Leech has done in Manifesto is to take the jaw dropping, gravity defying spectacle of trials riding and take it to a previously unheard of level. No one will leave the cinema without thinking that Ryan has superpowers.<br>The screening will be followed by a question and answer session with the audience and the opportunity to enjoy some never-before-seen footage of Ryan in action.<br><b><a href="http://www.ryanleech.com">www.ryanleech.com</a></b> <p><img height="271" alt="image" hspace="10" src="http://www.singletrackworld.com/mod/submit/images/2121-2.jpg" width="400" vspace="10" border="0"> <p><b>Photographic Exhibition to coincide with the Festival</b><br>Throughout the month of October, the GFT will be hosting an exhibition of the work of photographer Rob Hamilton Smith. Two years ago, Rob gave up a life in the UK as an IT consultant to follow his passions as a travelling mountain biker and photographer in Europe. Luck and being in the right place at the right time led him to living the dream working as a mountain bike guide in the singletrack heaven of Verbier whilst capturing the stunning riding and scenery of the Swiss Alps. Critical acclaim soon followed. The exhibition is a showcase for this exciting emerging talent.<br><b><a href="http://www.ryanleech.com">www.rhsimages.co.uk</a></b> <p>The Glasgow International Bike Film Festival would like to thank the Festival Sponsors without whom none of this would be possible: <a href="http://www.gft.org.uk">www.gft.org.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.bikelove.co.uk">www.bikelove.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.store51.co.uk">www.store51.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.thecyclejersey.com">www.thecyclejersey.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bikeverbier.com">www.bikeverbier.com</a>, <a href="http://www.endura.co.uk">www.endura.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.paligapltd.co.uk">www.paligapltd.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.chillivideo.com">www.chillivideo.com</a>, <a href="http://www.thecollectivefilm.com">www.thecollectivefilm.com</a>, <a href="http://www.cleancutfilms.ca">www.cleancutfilms.ca</a>, <a href="http://www.evermore.ch">www.evermore.ch</a>, <a href="http://www.ryanleech.com">www.ryanleech.com</a>, <a href="http://www.singletrackworld.com">www.singletrackworld.com</a></p>
