<p>I've just started using <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">KDiff3</a> as my diff and merge tool in Subversion.&nbsp; I'm stunned, this tool solves a problem that has bothered me for eons in VSS (and other merge tools). It shows the differences by character. Which means if only two characters have changed on a line it shows you. You're not left guessing which characters they were.</p>
<p>To use it: fire up your TortoiseSVN context menu and choose "settings". Select the Diff/Merge tab and point to KDiff as your diff and merge program.</p>
<p>It's that simple. </p>
