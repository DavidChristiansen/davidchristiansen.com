<p>This week I will be mostly learning about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/syllabi/en-us/2279Bfinal.mspx">2279b - Planning, Implementing, and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Active Directory Infrastructure</a> in which i have already discovered the delights of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/adam/adam/active_directory_application_mode.asp">ADAM.(Active Directory Application Mode)</a>. This is tool that we could use to help us develop our Active Directory enabled applications and sites without cheesing off our purchasing department with another purchase order for a development server. Also, there is a handy utility being release called <span class="label"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=88E72E3F-1DD9-4CCC-A9AA-CAC04E0628C7&displaylang=en)">Active Directory to Active Directory Application Mode Synchronizer BETA </a> </span>which will enable you to import an real active directory implementation into ADAM to prevent you having to manually duplicate it on your dev box.</p>
