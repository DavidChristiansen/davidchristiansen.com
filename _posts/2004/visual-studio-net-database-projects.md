<p>Database projects are special types of Visual Studio.NET projects which help you create and manage SQL database scripts. The Visual Database tools allow you to view, design, modify, and test database objects (for example, tables, views, queries, stored procedures, and so on) without having to jump from the Visual Studio environment to a different toolset.</p>
