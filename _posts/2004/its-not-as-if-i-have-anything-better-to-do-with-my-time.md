<p>Am I alone on this one...</p>
<p>From an early age I have found that if I have ever had a lot of work ahead of me, or something really important to do, I ALWAYS find something else to do instead.</p>
<p>Now, take my modifications to this blog as a case in point. I have a huge amount of work on my desk as I would typically, but especially this week as I have been on a <a href="http://www.learningit.com/">Microsoft Course this week at Learning IT</a>&nbsp;so the presure has really been building up like a huge pluke on your chin ready for a squeezing (not that i've had one of them for a while (honest!)). We are currently undertaking some major impact IT projects at work so there's alot of big questions to answer. On top of that I have already committed to two projects on overtime so that's been my evenings and most of my weekends booked up for at least the last two months and a couple more to come.</p>
<p>So why have I spent the last 2 hours playing around with custom DHTML stylesheet for ma blog ??</p>
