<p><em>Well it's new to me...</em></p>
<p><a href="http://webmessenger.msn.com"><strong>http://webmessenger.msn.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Just discovered webmessenger from MSN which provides web based instant messaging to those unfortunate enough to be on a PC without the windows app, or like me, work for an tightly firewalled corporation.</p>
<p>The project is still in Beta so who knows what's going to happen but for now I'm back online chatting during office hours for the first time in years...work related chat of course :!</p>
