<p>Not one to typically laugh at Microsoft when they screw up (??) but today an article on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>news.bbc.co.uk</strong></a>&nbsp;heralds <a href="http://beta.search.msn.co.uk/"><strong>http://beta.search.msn.co.uk/</strong></a>&nbsp;as the latest significant rival to google and yahoo!.</p>
<p>All fine and well, and it's never a bad thing when a new comprehensive search engine comes on-line, but cummon guys... it doesn't make life for the marketing team easy when potential 'client' receive...</p>
<p><font color="#ff7f00"><strong>This site is temporarily unavailable, please check back soon.</strong></font></p>
<p>...after searching for <strong>Microsoft.</strong></p>
<p>I'm hoping that this is because they didn't expect the volume of curious visitors&nbsp;(like me) that they are&nbsp;receiving. No doubt that they'll use the load data to make improvements. The MSN Search team has also posted a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch/archive/2004/11/11/255560.aspx">blog entry</a> that gives more detail.<img height="1" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/aggbug/255635.aspx" width="1"><br></p>
<p>Personally I am of the mindset that high profile apps should not be depthcharge tested by the public... but hey!, without beta sites like this the t'internet would be a far quieter place.</p>
