<p>Thanks to <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/Tariq/">http://geekswithblogs.net/Tariq/</a> for showing me the light and the ways of <a href="http://www.alienware.co.uk/">Alienware</a>. I have a couple of quid spare after moving house and have been thinking of ways to waste it on obscene technokit.</p>
<p>I think I could find a place for a couple of alienware's products...let alone their workstation furniture !...</p>
<p>Right now i am planning for a tablet to be mounted a wall in the kitchen for keeping up to date with stuff and controlling the servers in the house....also handy for displaying those recipies whilst attempting to woo the fiancee with my culinary skills...(thinks: she's my fiancee, do i still need to woo her ?)</p>
<p>Anyways, off to put the money fire out in my pocket....THIS is retail therapy !</p>
