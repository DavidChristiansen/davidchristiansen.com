<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/SQL/2005Webcasts/"><strong>Start forming an orderly queue here...</strong></a></p>
<p>The Microsoft SQL product team is hosting special week of live MSDN Webcasts to provide you a sneak peak at what Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Beta 2 has in store for the future database development. SQL Server 2005 offers a new paradigm for database development that integrates SQL Server and the CLR to provide several major benefits including enhanced programming mode, enhanced safety and security, user defined types and aggregates, and a common development environment, where database development is integrated into the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 development environment.</p>
<p><b>Bonus:</b> Attend a live webcast in this series during the month of January and you will receive a SQL Server 2005 developer resource kit. Additionally, you could qualify for a Microsoft T-shirt or an Xbox System! See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/SQL/WebcastRules.aspx">official rules</a> for more details.</p>
