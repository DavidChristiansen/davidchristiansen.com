<p>Exciting news.</p>
<p>I am proud to announce that <strong>Glenn Block</strong> from Microsoft will be coming all the way from Seattle to Scotland on the 12th March to talk to you!. Glenn is a PM on the WCF team working on Microsoft’s future HTTP and REST stack and has been involved in some pretty exciting and ground-breaking Microsoft development mind-shifts in recent times.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the chance to hear him speak and ask him questions. The day will be split into two parts. <br>
<strong><br>
Favourite subjects from The Block <br>
</strong>The first couple of hours will see Glenn focus on talking about his current work basket – expect to see him talking about Windows Communication Foundation, web APIs, HTTP, REST, MEF, Patterns &amp; Practices and his experiences at the recent mvcConf 2 event! <br>
<strong><br>
Block unblocked chalk talk - your chance to ask Glenn anything he can answer <br>
</strong>The second half of the afternoon will be "yours" - a chalk'n'talk if you prefer. It will be your chance to have an open and frank conversation with Glenn, to ask him questions, to challenge him and to get answers to those questions that you’ve been saving for such a celebrity!</p>
