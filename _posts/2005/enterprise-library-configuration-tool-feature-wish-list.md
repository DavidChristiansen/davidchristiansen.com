<p>OK, used it for a while now and have had some "Damn i wish it did this" moments - I therefore thought I would share them with you as and when they happen.</p>
<p><b>Today's</b> </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Recent Configuration FIles</b><br>I wish there was list upon the File menu that allowed you to quickly load up recent configuration files....instead of having to navigate half way around the globe in order to load up that config file you were working on 10mins ago.</li></ul>
<p>Feel free to suggest your own...</p>
