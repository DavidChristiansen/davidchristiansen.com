<p>You know what would be really handy ??... if those boys at the Enterprise Library - Patterns and Practices team developed a CodeSmith template for building an Enterprise Library aware DALC....</p>
<p>I have downloaded and looked into developing numerous n-teir templates however never really have the time to start one from scratch...</p>
<p>Unless someone out there has already developed an Enterprise Library - Codesmith template using at least the data access block (and config block) ????</p>
