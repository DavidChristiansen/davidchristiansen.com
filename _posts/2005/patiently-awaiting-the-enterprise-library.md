<p>It's obviously going to be a popular addition to the P&amp;P collection, going by the fact that it's <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/dchristiansen/admin/www.gotdotnet.com">GotDotNet.com</a> workspace has not been responding to our teams web queries today. The latest I have noticed is that there is now a link on the Microsoft P&amp;P site for the library, however it resolves a 404. Let's hope its lives up to our estimations...</p>
<p>I've been trying to keep up to date with new blogs relating to this latest addition:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/tomholl">Tom Hollander's blog - Project manager of MS Patterns and Practices (inc. Enterprise Library)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore">Being Scott Densmore&nbsp;- P&amp;P project member and generally an angry coder</a></li></ul>
