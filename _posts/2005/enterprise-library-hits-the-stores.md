<p>Well, here it is. The eagerly awaited patterns and practices library of codeblocks (and samples) which should be considered for inclusion in the development of any .NET enterprise development. Here's what Tom's got to say.... </p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><font size="2"><font color="#a9a9a9"><i>One of the many things we have tried to improve in Enterprise Library is what were calling the golden hour experience. This is the about the experience that customers face in the first hour or so, from finding the deliverable on Microsoft.com, determining if they want to download it, download, installation and initial evaluation. Theres a whole lot of stuff in Enterprise Library and we do expect it to take a while for you to get a hold of it all but in the meantime, please let me know how we did on the golden hour. What worked well? What didnt work well? How does it compare with our earlier blocks? In which areas are you planning on diving into more detail?</i> </font></font></p></blockquote>
