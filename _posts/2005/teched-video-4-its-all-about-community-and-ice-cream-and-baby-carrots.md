<p>On another note, I installed the <a href="http://messenger.msn.co.uk/download/Default.aspx">MSN Messenger V7</a>&nbsp;release last night and quite impressed. I am always amazed at how quickly software like this populates the PCs of people I know....almost like a virus. Anyways, Last night's coding efforts were accompanied by watching the personal messages aside my contact's names and seeing just how bad their taste in music is - Messenger can be configured to populate your personal message with the details of your currently playing song...</p>
<p>The Video and Audio quality is awsome&nbsp;aswell... Tried it last night talking to my cousin in Sydney and was v. impressed. </p>
