<p>This raised a smile in the office today.... </p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><i>A woman has come up with a novel use of the Freedom of Information Act - to find out how many eligible bachelors belong to her local police force.</i></p>
<p><i>The woman made an anonymous inquiry to Hampshire Constabulary to find out the current number of single officers. She also asked to know their email and home addresses and their promotion and pension prospects. The force declined to give out personal details but revealed there were 2,000 single officers in the county.</i> </p></blockquote>
