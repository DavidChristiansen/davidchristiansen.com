<p>I, like other ASP.NET developers, have always used a server OS as a development environment - typically due to a objection to having to hack XP in order to get multiple virtual IIS hosts.</p>  <p>So Windows 2003 was good to me, thank you Windows 2003 Server. I ran it on all my environments. Very few complaints about it as a whole</p>  <p>I appear to be one of the few who love Windows Vista as a 'home platform' - but also loved IIS7 from first glance. As a result I was instantly interested in Windows Longhorn so when it was possible for me to get my grubby little hands on a RTM release, that ISO was installed on my Sony Vaio.</p>  <p>Here are a few things I learnt along the way.</p>  <p>Â </p>  <blockquote>   <p>In general, Windows 2008 is WAY quicker and more responsive than Vista - but has all the flair - win win situation as far as I am concerned.</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p>Only a few glitches along the way but nothing major</p>    <p>Logitech Webcam (Sphere / Orb) do not appear to be recognised - using the same drivers as Vista.</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Skype</strong></p>    <p>The latest version of Skype (at time of writing) did not install on 2008. In order to get skype installed I had to resort to a previous version - I recommend v2.5.0.154 (@ <a title="http://www.oldapps.com/download.php?oldappsid=SkypeSetup%202.5.0.154.exe" href="http://www.oldapps.com/download.php?oldappsid=SkypeSetup%202.5.0.154.exe">http://www.oldapps.com/download.php?oldappsid=SkypeSetup%202.5.0.154.exe</a>)</p>    <p>I am going to try to upgrade to the latest version from 2.5.0.154 - will let you know!</p>    <p><strong>Live Messenger and Writer </strong></p>    <p>These apps need to be installed from stand-alone installers (<a title="http://www.live-writer.de/windows-live-writer-download/" href="http://www.live-writer.de/windows-live-writer-download/">http://www.live-writer.de/windows-live-writer-download/</a> &amp; <a title="http://www.techspot.com/blog/129/how-to-run-windows-live-messenger-on-windows-xp-x64/" href="http://www.techspot.com/blog/129/how-to-run-windows-live-messenger-on-windows-xp-x64/">http://www.techspot.com/blog/129/how-to-run-windows-live-messenger-on-windows-xp-x64/</a>)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I will update this posting with anything else I find different from my vista or 2003 dev experience.</p>
