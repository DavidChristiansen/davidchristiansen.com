We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets, not to mention, the risks we took hitchhiking .</p>  <p>As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. Riding in the back of a van - loose - was always great fun.</p>  <p>We drank water from the garden hosepipe and NOT from a bottle.</p>  <p>We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle and NO ONE actually died from this.</p>  <p>We ate cakes, white bread and real butter and drank pop with sugar in it, but we weren't overweight because ...</p>  <p><strong>WE WERE ALWAYS OUTSIDE PLAYING!!</strong></p>  <p>We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on.</p>  <p>No one was able to reach us all day. And we were O.K.</p>  <p>We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then ride down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem.</p>  <p>We did not have Playstations, Nintendo's, X-boxes, no video games at all, no 99 channels on cable, no video tape movies, no surround sound, no cell phones, no text messaging, no personal computers, no Internet or Internet chat rooms ...</p>  <p><b>WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside and found them!</b></p>  <p>We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and there were no lawsuits from   <br>these accidents.</p>  <p>We played with worms and mud pies made from dirt, and the worms did not live in us forever.</p>  <p>We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and although we were told it would happen, we did not poke out any eyes.</p>  <p>We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and knocked on the door or rang the bell, or just yelled for them!</p>  <p>Local teams had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment. Imagine that!!</p>  <p>The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of ...</p>  <p><b>They actually sided with the law!</b></p>  <p>This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever! The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas.</p>  <p>We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned ...</p>  <p><b>HOW TO </b> <b>DEAL WITH IT ALL!</b></p>  <p><b>And YOU are one of them!</b> <b>CONGRATULATIONS!</b></p>
