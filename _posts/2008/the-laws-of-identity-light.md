<p>People using computers should be in control of giving out information about themselves, just as they are in the physical world.</p>  <p>The minimum information needed for the purpose at hand should be released, and only to those who need it. Details should be retained no longer than necesary.</p>  <p>It should NOT be possible to automatically link up everything we do in all aspects of how we use the Internet. A single identifier that stitches everything up would have many unintended consequences.</p>  <p>We need choice in terms of who provides our identity information in different contexts.</p>  <p>The system must be built so we can understand how it works, make rational decisions and protect ourselves.</p>  <p>Devices through which we employ identity should offer people the same kinds of identity controls - just as car makers offer similar controls so we can all drive safely.</p>
