<p>NetIDme's <a href="http://www.netidme.net/aboutus/bbfc-online-accreditation.html">age-verification system</a> has been accredited by the British Board of Film Classification for its new media download classification scheme. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/bbfcOnline/bbfcOnline.php">BBFC.online</a> was launched in May and uses the Board's famous 'black cards’ and category symbols to enable users downloading new media content − video-on-demand and streamed video which is offered to the public through websites, set-top boxes and portable media devices − to judge whether it is suitable for consumption. </p>
<p><strong>NetIDme Chief Executive Alex Hewitt said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“BBFC.online is a revolutionary scheme that enables the application of the same rules in the online world that have been developed over many years to protect people in the real world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be one of the first companies to be accredited under the British Board of Film Classification's scheme - and the only one capable of verifying under 18s - is a ringing endorsement of our age-verification software, which is currently used by a number of blue chip companies." </p>
<p><strong>Andy Cooke, Business Manager for BBFC.online, said: </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are pleased to commend NetIDme as a novel solution for our members in meeting their obligations to age-verify viewers of digital content in the 12, 15 and adult categories, whilst minimizing the exposure of younger viewers to potential abuse of their personal information." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BBFC.online scheme was devised after findings showed independent classification of downloadable or streaming video content, either on the internet or delivered by video-on-demand (VoD) services and via set-top-boxes, was patchy across the UK.</p>
<p>Independent research indicated that 63 per cent of adults (74 per cent of parents) were concerned about downloading video material which does not come with independent content advice and labelling. In addition, 84 per cent of adults (91 per cent of parents) wanted to see BBFC film and DVD classification on downloadable/streaming films and other digital audiovisual content.</p>
<p>BBFC.online has been developed over the past 18 months, in close partnership with the video and new media industries and the British Video Association.</p>
<p>The scheme also requires e-tailers and VoD services to have in place age-verification software such as that produced by NetIDme to enable parents to monitor and control underage viewing. </p>
<p>NetIDme was founded in August 2006 by Alex Hewitt after he was concerned over his daughter's use of instant messaging. He was astonished to find that of the 150 people on his daughter's online friends list she knew only 50.</p>
<p>NetIDme provides patented identity verification and communication solutions for online communities and ecommerce sites. The NetIDme service is currently available in the UK, Australia, Canada and the USA.</p>
