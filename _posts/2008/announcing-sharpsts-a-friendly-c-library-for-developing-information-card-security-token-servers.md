It's called <a href="https://sharpsts.com" target="_blank"><strong>SharpSTS</strong></a>.</p>  <p>Working alongside (more learning from) two of my very intelligent friends <a href="http://idunno.org/"><strong>Barry Dorrans</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.leastprivilege.com/"><strong>Dominick Baier</strong></a>, we have launched a comprehensive C# .Net library that aims to simplify the involvement for everyone that wants to develop Information Card security token services.</p>  <p>The releases for SharpSTS <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sharpSTS" target="_blank"><strong>live at CodePlex</strong></a>. We also have set up a demo site / 'play' area at <a href="https://sharpsts.com"><strong>https://sharpsts.com</strong></a>.</p>  <p>More news to follow!...</p>
