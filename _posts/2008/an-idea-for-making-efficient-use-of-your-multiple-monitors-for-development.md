<p class="flickr-yourcomment"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.outofmemory.co.uk/"><strong>Andrew Rimmer</strong></a> mentioned <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/AndrewRimmer/statuses/785923656">on  twitter</a> that he wanted to make more efficient use of his multiple monitors  and I thought I would share how I have managed to achieve an effective way to  work with two or more monitors.</p>
<p class="flickr-yourcomment">I have long been an advocate for multiple monitors.  But frankly if you are sitting there with two or more monitors and looking at  your lovely desktop picture from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.interfacelift.com/"><strong>InterfaceLift</strong></a><strong> </strong>on one of them  then you may as well have saved your money.</p>
<p class="flickr-yourcomment">The picture above is an example of how I have set  out Visual Studio to make the most effective use my multiple monitor real  estate. In this example we have a low (ish) res laptop monitor and a larger res  external monitor. </p>
<p class="flickr-yourcomment">For my three monitor setup in the office I have the  main screen as the IDE code screen, flanked by two equal resolution monitors,  one hosting all the panels and plugins for Visual Studio, and the other monitor  being shared by SQL profiler, IM clients, email client and IE instances sharing  the other monitor.</p>
<p class="flickr-yourcomment">You will have to set up this layout for both normal  coding, AND debugging - of course debugging you will want a different set of  panels, for example locals, watches etc. in addition to solution explorer.</p>
<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Hope you find this of interest</p>
