We don't need no web server      <br></strong>Remoting is dead. Long live WCF. This session aims to cover the creation of web services with WCF, inside and outside of IIS, including one way and two way services, as well as contracts, faults, authentication, authorisation and security.</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Barry_Dorrans">Barry Dorrans</a>     <br><strong>How safe are your web sites?</strong>     <br>Do you know what cross site scripting is? SQL injection attacks? Search engine leaks? Learn how to check your sites for nasties by seeing how it's done against badly written code and what you can do to secure your sites.</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Barry_Dorrans">Barry Dorrans</a>     <br><strong>Managing Identity using Windows Cardspace</strong>     <br>Windows CardSpace is a framework developed by Microsoft which securely stores digital identities of a person, and provides a unified interface for choosing the identity for a particular transaction, such as logging in to a website. This talk will cover the identity metasystem, how CardSpace works and how you can use within it ASP.NET.</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Richard_Fennell">Richard Fennell</a>     <br><strong>'But it works on my PC' or Continuous Integration to improve quality.</strong>     <br>How many times have you heard the developer say ‘but it works on my PC ’? How much time have you wasted trying to get a complex solution to build on a new PC? In this session I will show how continuous integration, the automated building and testing of projects whenever files are checked in, can be used to improve the quality of any software development project. Helping to catch and resolve problems as soon as possible in the development cycle; not waiting until to delivery phase of a project to find there are integration problems. The session will include demos of continuous integration using Cruise Control and Visual Studio Team Server, as well as discussions of integration with other system such as NUnit, MSTest and Virtual Server.</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Ben_Lamb">Ben Lamb</a>     <br><strong>How to Write Crap Code in C# - Anti Patterns for Performance</strong>     <br>Most developers want the best possible performance from their code. Inspired by the idea of "proof by contradiction" this talk looks at how to write slow code and how the .NET platform, Windows and the processor will try and sabotage your efforts. A variety of techniques for inefficient coding will be covered including:  <br>• Flow control with Exceptions  <br>• Abusing Threads  <br>• Misuse of the Heap  <br>It's one man against some of the brightest minds in Redmond, seeking an answer to the question "How Slow Can It Go?"</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Ben_Lamb">Ben Lamb</a></p>  <p><strong>Being Lazy with Microsoft Powershell</strong>     <br>Microsoft PowerShell is a new command-line and script language that’s including with Windows Server 2008 and can be downloaded for Vista and XP. Written in .NET and completely extensible PowerShell provides plenty of opportunities to be lazy by reusing the infrastructure in your own applications. This talk will demonstrate some ideas including:  <br>• Controlling 3rd party tools and services from the command-prompt  <br>• Providing an command-based administration interface for your application  <br>• Allowing users to add functionality to your app using PowerShell as a scripting language  <br>This talk assumes no previous knowledge of PowerShell, it will look at extending it with C# code and key concepts rather than being a PowerShell tutorial. The command prompt has never been so exciting!</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Ben_Lamb">Ben Lamb</a>     <br><strong>Go with the Flow - An Introduction to Windows Workflow      <br></strong>Changing business requirements are the bugbear of the application developer. The Windows Workflow Engine (WWF) allows business rules to be modelled in a graphical environment, possibly by a business analyst rather than the developer, making changes easier to accommodate. This talk explains the concepts behind Windows Workflow Foundation and demostrates its use.</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Chris_Hay">Chris Hay</a>     <br><strong>Silverlight 2.0</strong>     <br>In this session we will take a whistlestop tour of all the new features of Silverlight 2.0 beta. SInce the beta is not out yet (the list below may differ), but we are likely to cover the following:     <br>- DataBinding     <br>- Styles     <br>- Control Templates     <br>- New Controls (TextBox, Checkbox, etc.)     <br>- New Layout Managers (StackPanel, Grid, etc.)     <br>- DataGrid (hopefully, assuming its there)     <br>- Networking Support (RSS, REST, SOAP)     <br>- New features in the Base Class Library.     <br>Maximum Live Coding, Maximum Demos, Minimum Slides</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Abid_Quereshi">Abid Quereshi</a>     <br><strong>Introduction to Microsoft Solutions Framework</strong>     <br>Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) has been called Microsoft's best-kept secret - and for good reason. Microsoft has developed and uses MSF to build technology solutions within product groups and within their Consulting Services group. MSF is a result of 25 years of delivering software solutions in a complex and changing industry. Every developer wants to be on a winning team and contribute to successful projects. Learn from the pros.     <br>This talk will present an introduction to MSF foundational principles, process model, team model, concepts, and proven practices from Microsoft. We will also show you how MSF fits into other frameworks and practices such as Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI), ITIL and agile development methods. The material will be presented from the software developer's perspective.</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Tom_Wardill">Tom Wardill</a>     <br><strong>ASP.NET MVC: Testing the Web. Is the new MVC framework for ASP.NET the future for .NET web development?</strong>     <br>An overview of the 3.5 Extensions, and how the will affect .NET web development in the future, bringing ASP.NET in to line with the new generation of toolkits, such as Ruby on Rails and TurboGears. We also explore the test capabilities offered by this framework, and explain how the new extensions can solve the problems presented by WebForms development in writing clean, testable and maintainable web applications.</p>  <p><a href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Beverley_Hatchard">Beverley Hatchard</a>     <br><strong>The User Experience</strong>     <br>The user experience is different for every user. This sessiion will discuss various interfaces that the user has to deal with. There is a lot of advice out there about how to make the user experience better, more intuitive and more productive yet every day users complain about how difficult it is to do simple tasks. The users blame the programmers, the designers blame the users. Is there a way out? Do best practices always work? Do you have a magic bullet?     <br>If you have an interface that you have worked on (or had to provide code to support functions of the interface) and would like it included, please contact me via the organisers (<a href="mailto:enquiries@developerdayscotland.com">enquiries@developerdayscotland.com</a>).</p>
