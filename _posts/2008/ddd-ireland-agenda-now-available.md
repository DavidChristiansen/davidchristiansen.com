<div style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; background-color: white; text-align: center"><a href="http://www.dddireland.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://davidchristiansenblog.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dddireland_thumb-gif.gif"></a> </div>  <p><a href="http://www.craigmurphy.com/blog/?p=786" target="_blank"><strong>Craig Murphy has just posted</strong></a> and started the <a href="http://www.dddireland.com"><strong>DDD Ireland</strong></a> beats sounding here in blogsphere!</p>  <p>The web-site itself carries most of the salient information, however do expect it to change its look’n'feel over the next few weeks - they are planning to adopt the full <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> experience!</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This is a <a href="http://www.developerday.co.uk"><strong>DDD-styled</strong></a> event, insomuch as it’s held on a <strong>Saturday</strong>, it’s <strong>free</strong>, there are no Microsoft speakers on the agenda, there’s a mix of regular experienced speakers and a few fresh faces and there’s an excellent opportunity for a social activity afterwards!</p> </blockquote>  <p>And as of today we can all <a href="http://www.dddireland.com/agenda-1.htm" target="_blank"><strong>view the agenda</strong></a> : this is still subject to slight alteration as they have one or two speaker confirmations outstanding. </p>  <p>I read the following paragraph from Craig's post with interest:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>In addition to the agenda’s five tracks, there is a <strong>WCF In Depth</strong> track where you can immerse yourself in the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx"><strong>Windows Communication Foundation</strong></a>, learning from <a href="http://www.leastprivilege.com/"><strong>Dominick Baier</strong></a>, <a href="http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/"><strong>Christen Weyer</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.lennybacon.com/"><strong>Daniel Fisher</strong></a> and Michael Willers. This is essentially a full day’s worth of training that won’t cost you a penny in attendance charges!</p> </blockquote>  <p>That's fantastic news! I can't wait.</p>  <p>If you are a Facebook user, they have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=10177306185">group</a> and an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=7687512883">event</a> setup already.</p>
