The film went on to win several prestigious awards and quickly became recognised by mountain bikers around the world as the film that the mountain bike world had been waiting for. In 2006, their second film, Roam, was released to even greater critical and commercial success. The film played to a series of sell out cinema screening throughout the UK.</p>  <p>Now in 2008, The Collective are back with their eagerly anticipated third feature, "Seasons".</p>  <p>Following seven of the worlds top mountain bikers through the course of the four seasons of the year, "Seasons" brings cinematic grandeur to the genre of mountain bike films. From the heat of competition downhill racing to riders ripping singletrack against the backdrop of a summer sunset, "Seasons" is a must see for film fans and bike fans alike. The film stars the biggest names in mountain biking including former UCI World Cup Downhill Champion Steve Peat.</p>  <p>To kick off the UK tour, we've teamed up with CycleSurgery www.cyclesurgery.com to present the UK Cinema Premiere at the Prince Charles Cinema in the heart of London's West End. This will give viewers the first chance to see "Seasons" anywhere in the UK. The screening date and time are below and the price of admission gets you to not only see "Seasons" on the big screen but also The Collective's previous feature "Roam" and an exclusive short on the making of "Seasons"</p>
